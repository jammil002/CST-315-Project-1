When working with the 2 threads I used an array named buffer. This array had value added to it via the producer and then those said values we removed using the consumer. A different thread was created for each of these functions. I used a global count variable to handle the positioning and numbering in the buffer array.

To run said code download and run the executable under releases to the right >
